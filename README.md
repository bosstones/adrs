# Architectural Decision Records for bosstones.net

Inspired by [Github's ADR process](https://adr.github.io):
> An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. An Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture and quality. An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD, such as often done when writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created and maintained in a project constitute its decision log. All these are within the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM).

As part of building _bosstones.net_, we would like to start off with a strong documented process so we know and understand how techincal decisions were made and how to unfuck things when problems and challenges arise. This repo will hold a running log of all of our ADRs.
